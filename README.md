Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a driver's education company that offers driving lessons based on appointments and online practice tests. The client was the driver's education company, and they wanted a system that could handle scheduling, appointment management, location selection, driver information viewing, and package selection for their users.

What did you do particularly well?
I was very thorough in my research and diagrams. I spent hours perfecting them so they would be presentable. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise Project 2, as a whole. It wasn't bad work but definitely was not my best. I quickly rushed thorugh it and missed aspects on digrams that I would have added given the time. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I made notes of the user's needs based on the interview provided. Timelines were documented early on and I kept track of the notes to ensure that I was addressing all of the needs in detail. Considering the user's needs is crucial in designing any software system as it ensures that the system aligns with the expectations and requirements of the end-users. This leads to higher user satisfaction, increased adoption, and ultimately, the success of the software solution.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I take a head first apporach. I dive right in to determine what the user wants out of the system and build a branch map for each detail. This allows me to see where the system will overlap in places and create a product quicker without repetitive code. In the future, I will pay more attention in my diagrams. I missed details I would have added and that can lead to confusion when coding the project.
